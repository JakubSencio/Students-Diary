# Students-Diary

The "Students-Diary" project has been created in C# using Windows Forms and is designed for managing a student diary. In the main menu of the project, four buttons have been introduced, providing the following options:

- Add Button: 
This button allows the user to add new entries related to students to the diary. Upon clicking the "Add" button, a new window or dialog box opens, where the user can input student information, such as name, ID, grades, etc. After entering the data and clicking the "Save" or "Add" button on the new form, the information about the new student is added to the diary.

- Delete Button: 
The "Delete" button enables the user to remove selected student entries. To implement this functionality, a list of student entries is displayed in the main window (e.g., using a DataGridView or ListBox). When the user selects a student entry and clicks the "Delete" button, they are prompted for confirmation, and upon confirmation, the selected entry is removed from the diary.

- Edit Button: 
The "Edit" button allows the user to modify information about a selected student. Similar to the "Add" button, clicking the "Edit" button opens a new window or dialog box with the selected student's details pre-filled. After making necessary changes and clicking "Save" or "Update," the student's information in the diary is updated.

- Refresh Button: 
The "Refresh" button is used to reload and display the current state of the student diary. This is useful in case the user makes changes and wants to see the updated data.

The option to add a student opens in a separate window, similar to the one above.



This project helped me understand the utilization of these concepts in the backend world.<br>
- Serialization - Serializing data for storage or transmission. (Xml) <br>
- Deserialization - Deserializing data to convert it back to its original format.<br>
- Refactoring - Restructuring and optimizing code without changing its external behavior.<br>
- LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) - Querying and manipulating data within code.<br>
- Inheritance - Creating new classes based on existing ones.<br>
- Polymorphism - Using objects of different types through a common interface or base class.<br>
- Abstraction - Defining simplified and generalized representations of objects.<br>
- Encapsulation - Restricting access to an object's internal state.<br>
- Composition - Building complex objects from simpler ones.<br>
- Delegates - Representing and invoking methods as objects.<br>
- Events - Implementing the observer pattern to handle notifications.<br>
- Asynchronicity - Performing tasks concurrently without blocking the main program.<br>


ToDo:
- Statistic of Students
- Online base
- Soon new similar app for company
